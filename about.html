<br><b>Benefits of Autonomous Status</b><br>
<b>Academic Freedom:</b> <br>The Autonomous Status accords an institution with the freedom to frame the syllabus and customize it as per the needs of the Industry. Students are taught the latest and relevant technologies to make them competent in the market. Experts from various industries and experienced academicians from reputed institutes are consulted in the process of framing the syllabus. Dedicated efforts are made to ensure that the syllabus framed is “Employment Centric” and potentially lucrative.

MOUs with reputed industries and organizations will enable the institution to offer one or two courses in every semester which can be taught by experts from industries/organizations. Such a move will help the students to acquire latest technical knowledge. This will bridge the gap between the industry and the institution, thereby enabling the student to be industry ready.</br>

<b>Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS):</b> <br>We follow the ‘Choice Based Credit System’. CBCS has numerous advantages over the conventional system. Rather than evaluating student-performance using marks and percentages, which many a time can be very inconsistent and unfair. CBCS uses Grades and Grade Point Averages (GPA) to evaluate student-performance. Using Grades and GPAs instead of marks and percentages provides a more holistic metric to measure student performance.<br>
Better Subject Choice and Electives : In addition to regular electives, open electives are offered by different departments to all the students. This will enable the students to choose interdisciplinary electives.

Certification Courses offered by reputed institutions such as IITs and IISc, Companies like Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, National Instruments, Autodesk, etc are made available. Students are given assistance to prepare for such certification courses. The college encourages the students to use online courses through MOOCs and Spoken Tutorials programme offered by IITB, Mumbai. Appropriate credit benefits are given to the students who receive these certificates.

The college uses modern teaching techniques such as E-Resources and Flipped Class Rooms. Peer tutoring concept is effectively adopted to help the slow learners in their studies. The college is approved as a nodal centre for the use of Virtual Laboratory, which is initiated by MHRD and supported by IITs and NITs is used in the curriculum. In addition to the experiments which can be physically conducted, a few virtual lab experiments are included in all the laboratory courses and integrated courses.<br>
